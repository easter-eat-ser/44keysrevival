# 44 Keys
### The iOS game, revived!
44 (also known as 44 Keys) is a little-known iOS game, where you use tilt controls to guide a blocky character through a maze, the objective being to get 44 keys.
After some quick research on Youtube, it seemed there was just enough information and footage of this game to make a recreation. So... here we are!

## STUFF THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
so, uh... the physics aren't quite that great yet. also, moving objects haven't been implemented yet
